# Computational Microbial Genomics Project (2024)

The aim of this project is to obtain as much information as possible about a dental plaque SGB, starting from a set of 30 genomes (MAGs). More specifically, our main goal is to find whether peri-implantitis could be characterized by the bacteria present in different plaque samples. Furthermore, by comparing the results obtained from our analysis with the patients’ metadata, we aim to identify some external factors, such as smoking, obesity and sex, that could influence the disease’s develop- ment. These studies will be based on the analysis of the assembly and of the bacterial genomes.
Regarding the workflow, genomes have firstly been collected from the oral cavity of Italian patients after the dental implants were applied.
Then, bacterial genomes have been sequenced by a high-throughput machine. Finally, the output MAGs were further analyzed.

In order to get the most out of a set of MAGs, we proceeded with the following pipeline: 
1. Taxonomic Assignment
2. Genome Annotation
3. Pangenome Analysis
4. Phylogenetic Analysis
5. Association with Host Metadata
